  abstract={GPUs are increasingly utilized for running DNN tasks on 
  emerging mobile edge devices. Beyond accelerating single task inference, 
  their value is also particularly apparent in efficiently executing 
  multiple DNN tasks, which often have strict latency requirements in 
  applications. Preemption is the main technology to ensure multitasking timeliness, 
  but mobile edges primarily offer two priorities for task queues, and 
  existing methods thus achieve only coarse-grained preemption by categorizing 
  DNNs into real-time and best-effort, permitting a real-time task to preempt 
  best-effort ones. However, the efficacy diminishes significantly when other 
  real-time tasks run concurrently, but this is already common in mobile edge 
  applications. Due to different hardware characteristics, solutions from other 
  platforms are unsuitable. For instance, GPUs on traditional mobile devices 
  primarily assist CPU processing and lack special preemption support, mainly 
  following FIFO in GPU scheduling. Clouds handle concurrent task execution, 
  but focus on allocating one or more GPUs per complex model, whereas on mobile 
  edges, DNNs mainly vie for one GPU. This paper introduces Pantheon, designed 
  to offer fine-grained preemption, enabling real-time tasks to preempt each 
  other and best-effort tasks. Our key observation is that the two-tier GPU 
  stream priorities, while underexplored, are sufficient. Efficient preemption 
  can be realized through software design by innovative scheduling and novel 
  exploitation of the nested redundancy principle for DNN models. Evaluation 
  on a diverse set of DNNs shows substantial improvements in deadline miss 
  rate and accuracy of Pantheon over state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract={Abstractâ€”DTMM is a library designed for efficient deployment 
and execution of machine learning models on weak IoT
devices such as microcontroller units (MCUs). The motivation
for designing DTMM comes from the emerging field of tiny
machine learning (TinyML), which explores extending the reach
of machine learning to many low-end IoT devices to achieve
ubiquitous intelligence. Due to the weak capability of embedded
devices, it is necessary to compress models by pruning enough
weights before deploying. Although pruning has been studied
extensively on many computing platforms, two key issues with
pruning methods are exacerbated on MCUs: models need to be
deeply compressed without significantly compromising accuracy,
and they should perform efficiently after pruning. Current
solutions only achieve one of these objectives, but not both. In
this paper, we find that pruned models have great potential for
efficient deployment and execution on MCUs. Therefore, we propose
DTMM with pruning unit selection, pre-execution pruning
optimizations, runtime acceleration, and post-execution low-cost
storage to fill the gap for efficient deployment and execution
of pruned models. It can be integrated into commercial ML
frameworks for practical deployment, and a prototype system
has been developed. Extensive experiments on various models
show promising gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract={This paper introduces WETrak, a finger tracking system using wrist-worn electromyography (EMG) sensors. Recent finger tracking methods mainly employ EMGs on armbands. Compared to a range of contactless methods using cameras or wireless, they are not limited by high computational costs, privacy concerns, and mobility, while unlike other wearable-based approaches, they do not require the deployment of sensors on the user's hands. However, users need to wear an additional armband on their forearm each time solely for tracking purpose, which hinders the widespread adoption of finger tracking in practice. This paper investigates the feasibility of moving EMG sensors from the forearm to the wrist for finger tracking. WETrak inherits the advantages of existing EMG-based armband tracking while avoiding the limitation of requiring additional armbands, which brings a strong incentive for integrating EMG sensors into wrist-worn wearables in the future. As sensor placement varies, we find new challenges in determing good locations to place sensors to gather useful information to capture all finger movements and using low-quality signals to still ensure accurate tracking. In this paper, we introduce new, efficient solutions to these problems. We develop a prototype, and the results show that WETrak outperforms the state-of-the-art method and performs consistently well under various settings.}
